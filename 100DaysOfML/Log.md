# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 1 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : For a couple of hours trying to figure out how to use a scrapy tool. It's much more complicated than you might think at the first time. Now reading and testing http://scrapingauthority.com/scrapyfundamentals/ , and hope that will help.

**Thoughts** : Fear about that tool, licnce and so on. Hope the data I will parse not protected by law :). I almost got the point about parsing the image, need to sync it with additional categorical data. And do I really need that? Tomorrow will read about DeepFashion thoroughly. And hope I'll download it finaly.
    
    Plans:
        - Get photo of users clothes.
        - Categorize it.
        - Creat looks with categories.
        - Then use ensembles to predict look, or find familiar look.
