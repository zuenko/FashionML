# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed choosing the projects I will work on.

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exciting, will help me in Machine Learning in a more effective way. First of all, I need to find good dataset or make it.

## Day 1 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : For a couple of hours trying to figure out how to use a scrapy tool. It's much more complicated than you might think at the first time. Now reading and testing http://scrapingauthority.com/scrapyfundamentals/ , and hope that will help.

**Thoughts** : Fear about that tool, licnce and so on. Hope the data I will parse not protected by law :). I almost got the point about parsing the image, need to sync it with additional categorical data. And do I really need that? Tomorrow will read about DeepFashion thoroughly. And hope I'll download it finally.
    
    Plans:
        - Get photo of users clothes.
        - Categorize it.
        - Great looks with categories.
        - Then use ensembles to predict look, or find familiar look.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Picked [DeepFashion (Category and Attribute Prediction Benchmark)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion/AttributePrediction.html) dataset as the best one in my field. I've readed about cnn, object Detection, speed and accuracy comparing and so on. Installed darknet, watched videos about training and all that stuff. 

**Thoughts** : Want to figure out how to make dataset with good clothes combination, stylists? Also, yolo seemed pretty accurate and fast, but ssd pretty tough and mobilenet the fastest. And if I make the combination, can we actually use classic trees models or we need deep learning in that? So I have changed:
    
    Plans:
    	- Figure out how to make combination dataset.
    	- What about gans?
    	- Plan demo?
        - Is it possible to use ensembles to predict look, or find familiar look?

    Demo plan:
    	- Make demo
    	- ???
    	- Profit!
